# Testing with Selenium and Python
==================================

This little project contains scripts to test web pages. We have done this before but in the Java language. I have decided to move to Python
as it is easier to understand, in my opinon at least.

## Requirements

This project uses Selenium as the main testing framework and uses a Python virtual environment. The following will guide you to setup this project.

### Download Python

If you have Python already installed or you are on a Mac, ignore this part. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Download virtualenv

You can use the virtualenv package to start the project. use *pip install virtualenv* to install the package on your machine.
