# Testing with Selenium and Python
==================================

This little project contains scripts to test web pages. We have done this before but in the Java language. I have decided to move to Python
as it is easier to understand, in my opinon at least.

## Requirements

This project uses Selenium as the main testing framework and uses a Python virtual environment. The following will guide you to setup this project.

### Download Python

If you have Python already installed or you are on a Mac, ignore this part. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Download virtualenv

You can use the virtualenv package to start the project. use *pip install virtualenv* to install the package on your machine.

### Download The Webdrivers

In order for Selenium to work on browsers, we need to install the respective drivers for a web browsers. I have some popular drivers listed below
along with the download.

* Chrome: [chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
* Firefox: [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
* Opera: [operariver](https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases)
